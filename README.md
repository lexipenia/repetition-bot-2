# repetition-bot-2

An updated version of the [original repetition-bot](https://github.com/lexipenia/repetition-bot) that bypasses the Twitter API and instead uses Selenium to control an automated Chrome instance. This may prove more resilient against Twitter's attempts to block people posting the same thing again and again.

By making the bot save Chrome user preferences, it can stay logged in and not have to navigate the various Twitter login flows â€“ although it does make a noble attempt at getting through them if challenged.

## `config.py` and `chromedriver` location

The bot assumes that the appropriate version of [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) is installed at `/usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.

A `config.py` file in the same directory as the bot must be supplied, containing:
* The root of the path where `/chrome` and `/debug` directories will be created
* The desired Twitter login credentials

Example `config.py` file:
```
# choose how to extend the path for saving files (remote = absolute, for cronjob)
path_extensions = {
  "local": "./",
  "remote": "/home/<user>/repetition-bot-2/"
}

# Twitter login credentials
username = ""
password = ""
email = ""
phone = ""
```

## Dependencies
```
pip install selenium
```
